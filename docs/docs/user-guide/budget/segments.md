# 🧩 Budget Segments

## ❓ What is a Budget Segment

A budget segment is a subdivision of a budget that represents a specific portion of your total budget. Segments allow you to allocate your budget across different areas, priorities, or categories.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Name**: Each segment has a descriptive name (e.g., "Housing", "Food", "Entertainment", "Emergency Fund")
- **Percentage**: Each segment is assigned a percentage of the total budget
- **Part of a Budget**: Segments always belong to a specific budget

## 📊 Percentage Allocation

Each segment represents a **percentage of the total budget**. This percentage-based approach makes budgets flexible and scalable.

**Example:**
For a 3,000€ monthly budget:
- **Housing** - 40% (1,200€)
- **Food** - 20% (600€)
- **Transportation** - 15% ($450€)
- **Savings** - 15% (450€)
- **Entertainment** - 10% (300€)

**Total: 100%** ✓

## ✅ Benefits of Segments

- **Structured Planning**: Break down your budget into meaningful categories
- **Proportional Allocation**: Easily adjust total budget while maintaining proportions
- **Detailed Tracking**: Monitor spending in specific areas
- **Flexibility**: Segments can represent categories, goals, or any logical grouping

## 🎯 Segment Examples

Segments can be organized in many ways depending on your needs:

**By Category:**
- Housing (30%)
- Food (20%)
- Transportation (15%)
- Healthcare (10%)
- Entertainment (10%)
- Savings (15%)

**By Priority:**
- Essential Expenses (60%)
- Discretionary Spending (25%)
- Savings & Investments (15%)

**By Goal:**
- Regular Operations (70%)
- Vacation Fund (20%)
- Emergency Fund (10%)

**By Project:**
- Kitchen Renovation (50%)
- Landscaping (30%)
- Furniture (20%)

## 🔗 Segments and Transactions

Once you've created segments, you assign (impute) transactions to them. This is how you track actual spending against your budget plan. Learn more about this process in [Imputation](./imputation.md).

> **Note:** The sum of all segment percentages in a budget should equal 100%, though Balancia gives you flexibility in how you structure your segments based on your financial planning needs.
