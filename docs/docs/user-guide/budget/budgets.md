# 📊 Budgets

## ❓ What is a Budget

A budget in Balancia is a financial plan that helps you control and monitor your spending over a specific time period. Each budget has a name and covers a defined period, allowing you to set clear financial goals and track your progress.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Name**: Each budget has a descriptive name (e.g., "2026 Annual Budget", "Summer Vacation", "Q1 Savings Plan")
- **Time Period**: Every budget operates within a specific timeframe (e.g., January 2026, Q1 2026, Summer 2026)
- **Total Amount**: The overall budget amount that will be divided into segments

## 🔄 Multiple Budgets in the Same Period

One of Balancia's powerful features is the ability to run **multiple budgets during the same time period**. This flexibility allows you to track different financial objectives simultaneously.

**Why have multiple budgets?**
- Track different goals independently (e.g., overall yearly budget + specific project budget)
- Separate personal and business finances within the same timeframe
- Monitor special events or goals alongside your regular budget

**Example:**
You might have:
- **"2026 Annual Budget"** - Your main budget covering all yearly expenses
- **"Summer Vacation Budget"** - A specific budget for vacation planning during June-August 2026
- **"Home Renovation Budget"** - A project-specific budget running from March-December 2026

All three budgets can coexist and track the same transactions from different perspectives.

## 🎯 How Budgets Work

Budgets are divided into **segments** (see [Segments](./segments.md)), each representing a portion of your total budget. Transactions are then **imputed** (assigned) to these segments to track spending against your plan (see [Imputation](./imputation.md)).

## 📋 Use Cases

- **Annual Budget**: Track yearly income and expenses across all categories
- **Project Budget**: Monitor costs for specific projects (renovations, events, trips)
- **Savings Goals**: Create budgets to track progress toward savings targets
- **Department Budgets**: If managing household or business finances with multiple areas
- **Trial Budgets**: Test different budgeting strategies side-by-side

> **Note:** Budgets provide structure without limiting flexibility. You can adjust segments, impute transactions across multiple budgets, and modify your approach as your financial situation evolves.
