# Transactions ðŸ’¸

A transaction in Balancia represents a financial event, such as a purchase, income, or transfer. Every transaction is always linked to an account, ensuring your financial records are organized by source.

## Transaction Details
- **Account**: Every transaction must be associated with an account (e.g., bank account, credit card).
- **Subject**: A description or title for the transaction (e.g., "Grocery shopping", "Salary").
- **Timestamp**: The date and time when the transaction occurred.
- **Category**: Each transaction can have zero or one category, helping you classify spending or income (e.g., "Food", "Utilities").
- **Tags**: You can assign as many tags as you want to a transaction for flexible grouping and analysis (e.g., "Vacation", "Work").

## Importing Transactions
Transactions can be imported from a CSV file, making it easy to bring in data from your bank or other financial sources.

> **Note:** Transactions are the core data for financial analysis in Balancia. They are always linked to an account and can be further organized using categories and tags.
