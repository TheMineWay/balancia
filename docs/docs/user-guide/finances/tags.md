# 🏷️ Tags

Tags are flexible labels that you can assign to transactions in Balancia. They provide a way to group, filter, and analyze transactions beyond the limitations of categories.

## 🌐 Cross-Account Tagging
Like categories, tags are **not tied to specific accounts** – they work across your entire financial ecosystem. This enables:
- Tagging transactions from any account with the same labels
- Comprehensive analysis across all accounts
- **Example:** Tag all "Vacation" expenses whether paid by credit card, checking account, or cash, then analyze total vacation spending regardless of payment method

## ✅ What Tags are used for
- Marking transactions with custom labels (e.g., "Vacation", "Work", "Reimbursable")
- Filtering transactions by specific criteria
- Creating ad-hoc groups for analysis
- Assigning multiple tags to a single transaction

## ❌ What Tags are not used for
- Strict classification (use Categories for single-group classification)
- Representing accounts or individual transactions

## 📋 Examples
- **Vacation**: Tag all expenses related to a trip
- **Work**: Tag business-related transactions
- **Reimbursable**: Tag expenses to be reimbursed later

> **Note:** Each transaction can have any number of tags, making it easy to organize and analyze your financial data by custom criteria.
