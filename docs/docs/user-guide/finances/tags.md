# üè∑Ô∏è Tags

Tags are flexible labels that you can assign to transactions in Balancia. They provide a way to group, filter, and analyze transactions beyond the limitations of categories.

## What Tags Are Used For
- Marking transactions with custom labels (e.g., "Vacation", "Work", "Reimbursable")
- Filtering transactions by specific criteria
- Creating ad-hoc groups for analysis
- Assigning multiple tags to a single transaction

## What Tags Are Not Used For
- Strict classification (use Categories for single-group classification)
- Representing accounts or individual transactions

## Examples
- **Vacation**: Tag all expenses related to a trip
- **Work**: Tag business-related transactions
- **Reimbursable**: Tag expenses to be reimbursed later

Each transaction can have any number of tags, making it easy to organize and analyze your financial data by custom criteria.
