# ðŸ“‚ Categories

Categories are used to classify transactions into meaningful groups, making it easier to analyze your spending and income. Each transaction can have zero or one category, but never more than one.

## What Categories Are Used For
- Grouping transactions by type (e.g., "Food", "Utilities", "Salary")
- Analyzing spending patterns and budgeting
- Generating reports by category

## What Categories Are Not Used For
- Assigning multiple categories to a single transaction (use Tags for more flexibility)
- Representing accounts or individual transactions

## Examples
- **Food**: All grocery and restaurant expenses
- **Utilities**: Electricity, water, and internet bills
- **Salary**: Income from employment

> **Note:** A transaction can have at most one category assigned.
