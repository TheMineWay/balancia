# 🗓️ Changelog

## 📖 About This Changelog

This changelog tracks changes, improvements, and updates to the **NestFlux Core template** itself - the foundation that powers NestFlux applications.

### What's Included

This section documents:

- **Template Features**: New capabilities added to the core template
- **Infrastructure Changes**: Updates to the development environment, build process, and tooling
- **Dependencies**: Major library updates and framework changes
- **Architecture Improvements**: Structural changes to the template
- **Bug Fixes**: Corrections to template functionality
- **Documentation**: Updates to template documentation and guides

### What's NOT Included

This changelog does **not** cover:

- Application-specific features built on top of the template
- Custom business logic or domain-specific implementations
- User-facing application changes (unless they're part of the template)
- Individual project configurations or customizations

---

Think of this as the changelog for the **framework** that you build your application on, not the application itself.

:::info
While this changelog focuses on core template changes, keep in mind that updates to the template **indirectly affect your application**. Template improvements, bug fixes, and new features become available to all applications built on NestFlux, potentially enhancing functionality, security, and performance.
